# 1.8-Lambdas

## 📄Exercises Level 1 of Sprint1 Task 8

### Level1 Exercice1 :

This exercise focuses on utilizing Java Streams and Lambdas to efficiently filter a collection of data based
on a specific character presence.

1. Create a method designed to filter a input list of string:
    * The method must filter only the strings that contains the letter 'o';
    * The method must return and print a new list with the filtered results.

### Level1 Exercise 2

This exercise focuses on utilizing Java Streams and Lambdas to efficiently filter a collection of data based 
on multiple, chained conditions.

1. Create a method designed to filter a input list of string:
    * The method must filter the strings that contains the letter 'o' and are longest than 5 characters;
    * The method must return and print a new list with the filtered results.

### Level1 Exercise 3

This exercise focuses on the fundamentals of initializing a collection and using a Lambda Expression
for concise iteration and printing.

1. Create a data structure containing the names of the months of the year;
2. Print all the elements of the list with a Lambda.

### Level1 Exercise 4

Using the same structure created for the exercise 3:

1. Use a Lambda to print all the elements in reverse order

### Level1 Exercise 5

This exercise focuses on defining a custom Functional Interface and implementing its single 
abstract method using a Lambda Expression to return a specific constant value.

1. Define a Functional Interface that must contain one abstract method named getPiValue()
   which must return a double value;
2. Inside the main method (main()):
   * Instantiate the created Functional Interface using a Lambda Expression;
   * The Lambda Expression must be implemented to always return the constant value 3.1415.
3. Invoke the getPiValue() method on the instantiated interface object;
4. Print the returned double result to the standard output.
 
### Level1 Exercise 6

This exercise focuses on creating a list containing mixed data types (numbers and strings) and then 
sorting the String elements based on their length using a custom comparison logic.

1. Create a list capable of holding both numerical and text data;
2. Extract only the String elements from this list:
     *The extracted strings must be sorted from the shortest length to the longest length (ascending order);
3. The sorted list of strings must be printed to the standard output.


### Level1 Exercise 7

Using the same structure from the previous exercise:
1. Modifying the sorting logic to order the strings in descending order of length.

### Level1 Exercise 8

This exercise focuses on defining a custom Functional Interface and implementing its method using a 
Lambda Expression to perform a specific string manipulation (reversal).

1. Define a Functional Interface:
     * The interface must contain one abstract method named reverse();
     * This method must accept a String as a parameter and return a String.
2. Inside the main method (main()):
     * Instantiate the created Functional Interface using a Lambda Expression;
     * The Lambda Expression must implement the method logic to return the input string
        in reverse order.
3. Invoke the instance of the interface, passing it a test string;
4. Verify and print the returned reversed string result to the standard output to confirm its correctness.
